# gas_val_to_csv_for_ERDDAP

This repository is used to convert the text files with .txt extension from ASVCO2 gas validation into a csv format for ERDDAP.

## Installation

Make sure that python is already installed and added to the PATH. and use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

### Create a virtual environment and activate it

In Windows:  
Create a local subfolder, then open a command prompt (cmd) and use the command below.
```cmd
C:\my_local_subfolder> python -m venv .\.venv
```
The above command will create a virtual environment in the subfolder \'.venv\' within my_local_subfolder.
Next, activate the virtual environment with the activate .bat script.
```cmd
C:\my_local_subfolder> .\.venv\Scripts\acivate
```

In Linux:  
Create a local subfolder, then open a bash prompt in that subfolder.
```bash
my_name@my_PC:~/my_local_subfolder$ python3 -m venv ./venv
```
The above command will create a virtual environment in the subfolder \'.venv\' within my_local_subfolder.
Next, activate the virtual environment.
```bash
my_name@my_PC:~/my_local_subfolder$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```  
The virtual environment should now be active with a prompt similar to shown below.  
  
### Install Python packages into the virtual environment

In Windows:
```cmd
(.venv)C:\my_local_subfolder> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In Linux:
```bash
(venv)my_name@my_PC:~/my_local_subfolder$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
